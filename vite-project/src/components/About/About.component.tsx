            <h1>Professional Development Project (PDP) - Dev Pro</h1>

            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p>This PDP is designed to enhance my React.js skills through planned learning and hands-on practice. The
                goal was to build a complete web application using React for the frontend and PHP with a chosen framework
                for the backend.</p>

            <h2>Phase 1: Learning & Practice</h2>
            <p>To strengthen my understanding of React, I:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Watched the majority of the classes in the React course by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller on Udemy.</li>
                <li>Revisited previously learned React features and old React projects.</li>
                <li>Read some documentations and articles about:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Redux;</li>
                    <li>RTK;</li>
                    <li>React Router;</li>
                    <li>React Hooks;</li>
                    <li>Laravel;</li>
                    <li>JWT Authentication;</li>
                    <li>Restful API's;</li>
                    <li>Relationships in Relational Databases;</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <h2>Phase 2: Full-Stack Application Development</h2>
            <p>In this phase, I developed a web application with the following stack:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Laravel.</li>
                <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> React.js for the user interface.</li>
                <li><strong>Database:</strong> PostgreSQL for data storage.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Key Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>User management with registration and authentication.</li>
                <li>Multiple user roles with specific permissions.</li>
                <li>JWT token-based authentication for security.</li>
                <li>Responsive design for various devices.</li>
                <li>Functionalities such as account creation, project creation, custom team schemas, etc.</li>
                <li>Dynamic content loading via React (SPA) with the backend serving as a REST API.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This project helped solidify my skills in full-stack development and provide real-world experience in
                building modern web applications.</p>
